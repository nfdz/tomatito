# Tomatito

Android application implementation of pomodoro timer. I like this technique, I use it a lot while I work and I do any kind of task.

## TODO
* Implement pause feature

## Why create yet another application?

This project is mainly due to educational reasons. I wanted to try different Android features that I had not yet used (such as schedule time-sensitive with AlarmManager). This was the perfect excuse to implement a tiny and simple application with my approach of what a pomodoro timer should be.

## Underlying principles

There are six steps in the technique:
* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
* Work on the task until the timer rings.
* After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
* If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
* After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

## About

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
